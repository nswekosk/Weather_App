# Weather_App
This is an angular application which uses an open API to check the weather. I decided to build this for 2 reasons: one was to gain more experience in creating custom directives; the other was to gain more experience in creating a single-page application.

To use the application, you must add your API key to the variable titled 'API_KEY' in the service class. If you do not have an API_KEY, one can be retrieved by signing up for an account at 'openweathermap.org'.

Thank you!
